# FR-09 (Mobile) — Bug Reports

> Continuation item 5. All entries derive from `work/FR-09-coupon-mobile/execution-results.md`
> (4 FAILs out of 13 cases). Per
> `docs/implementation-plan/continuation-handoff-FR09-mobile.md` §8: 3 of the 4 FAILs reconfirm
> already-filed defects (issues #3, #4, #5) from a new, mobile-specific code path. The 4th FAIL
> is a genuinely new finding (a mobile-only compound chain, not covered by any of #1/#3/#4/#5
> individually) and is filed as a fresh bug report + GitHub issue (`BUG-09-001` → #25).
>
> **Discovery during filing, recorded plainly rather than silently worked around:** issue #3
> still exists and received a reconfirmation comment as planned. Issues **#4 and #5 were found
> to have been deleted** (`gh api .../issues/4` and `.../5` both return `410 "This issue was
> deleted"`, not merely closed) — the handoff's assumption that they were still open no longer
> holds. Since the underlying defects are still real, unfixed, and now re-confirmed by fresh
> mobile-specific evidence, fresh issues were filed in place of a comment (**#26** for the
> percent-formula defect, **#27** for the C3-boundary defect) — this is not a duplicate filing,
> since no live tracking artifact existed to comment on.

## Stage 1 — Confirm each failure is a real defect

The relevant confirmation question is: **is the defect correctly derived and reproducible?** For all 4: the source lines were re-read directly for this confirmation step, the arithmetic/control flow was re-traced by hand (e.g. `1,000,000 × (1 − 10) = -9,000,000`, confirmed), and each defect rests on a value that reaches its destination unconditionally (no branch, error handler, or intervening validation in the code that could break the chain). All 4 confirmed as real.

## Stage 2 — Grouping

- `ER-09-EP-003` → root cause: issue #3 (no auth on `apply-coupon`). Same root cause, new
  evidence path (the client's own code, not just the server's gap). **Reconfirmation, not a
  new group.**
- `ER-09-EP-004` → root cause: issue #4 (percent formula). Same root cause, traced to its exact
  mobile render. **Reconfirmation, not a new group.**
- `ER-09-BVA-002` → root cause: issue #5 (C3 boundary `>` vs `>=`). Same root cause, traced to
  its exact mobile render. **Reconfirmation, not a new group.**
- `ER-09-EP-006` → root cause: **neither #1 nor #4 alone** — it is the specific, unconditional
  code path chaining them (`handleConfirmCheckout`'s `total_amount: couponResult.final_amount`
  into `POST /api/checkout`'s unchecked insert). Fixing #4 (the formula) or #1 (checkout
  recomputation) independently would each separately close this path, but as of today, with
  neither fixed, this chain is its own distinct, newly-traced defect. **New group.**

## Reconfirmation — issue #3 (`POST /api/apply-coupon` has no authentication)

**Ref:** `TC-09-EP-003` / `ER-09-EP-003`.

**New evidence:** `frontend-mobile/App.js:358-372`
(`handleApplyCoupon`) never sends an `Authorization` header on this call, for any mobile user,
regardless of login state — identity is asserted purely via `user_id: user?.id || null` from
local app state. This means the mobile client's **own, honest, non-malicious** code already
constructs exactly the unauthenticated request issue #3 describes — the vulnerability is not
only reachable by a crafted attack; the official mobile client reaches it on every normal
coupon-apply tap.

**Action:** comment on GitHub issue #3 with this mobile-specific reinforcement; not filed as a
duplicate.

## Reconfirmation — issue #4 (percent-formula produces a negative discount)

**Ref:** `TC-09-EP-004` / `ER-09-EP-004`.

**New evidence:** `frontend-mobile/App.js:728-732`
renders `couponResult.discount_amount`/`final_amount` directly through `formatMoney`, with no
sign-check anywhere in the render path. Applying `SAVE10` to a 1,000,000₫ cart would show
**"Tiết kiệm: -9.000.000 ₫"** and **"Thành tiền: 10.000.000 ₫"** on the coupon box, under a
green "✅" success message — the bug is not only a wrong number in an API response; it is a
literal negative-savings figure that would render on the customer-facing mobile screen.

**Action:** issue #4 was found deleted (`410`) during filing — re-filed fresh as
[#26](https://github.com/BuhDuy256/eshop-sut-hw2-testing/issues/26), including this mobile
render trace directly in the new issue body, since no live issue existed to comment on.

## Reconfirmation — issue #5 (C3 threshold uses `>` instead of `>=`)

**Ref:** `TC-09-BVA-002` / `ER-09-BVA-002`.

**New evidence:** `frontend-mobile/App.js:376-378`/`722-724`
renders the backend's rejection message (`"Đơn hàng chưa đủ giá trị tối thiểu 300.000 ₫..."`)
verbatim. A mobile user whose cart totals exactly `SAVE10`'s `min_order_amount` (300,000₫) would
see this rejection on their own screen, denying a discount the spec entitles them to.

**Action:** issue #5 was found deleted (`410`) during filing — re-filed fresh as
[#27](https://github.com/BuhDuy256/eshop-sut-hw2-testing/issues/27), including this mobile
render trace directly in the new issue body, since no live issue existed to comment on.

## BUG-09-001 — Confirming mobile checkout after a broken percent-coupon apply persists a wildly inflated order total

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **ID** | `BUG-09-001` |
| **Title** | Mobile checkout persists `apply-coupon`'s broken percent-formula result as the order's stored total, with no recomputation |
| **Ref** | `TC-09-EP-006` (test case) / `ER-09-EP-006` (execution result) |
| **Severity** | Critical — `total_amount` is the SUT's sole financial record for an order (same reasoning as the already-confirmed `BUG-08-001`/issue #1: it is what the admin revenue dashboard aggregates, README line 183, and the only recorded amount owed). This chain persists a value **11× larger than the spec-correct total** (`10,000,000` vs. the correct `900,000`) and **10× the real cart value** (`1,000,000`), for any mobile user who applies a percent-type coupon and confirms checkout — not a rare edge case, since `SAVE10` is the system's flagship, most prominently seeded percent coupon. Both component mechanisms (#1: checkout trusts client `total_amount` verbatim; #4: percent formula inverts the discount) are **independently already confirmed via live execution** in the prior FR-08-Full pass — this report's own contribution is tracing the specific, unconditional mobile code path (`App.js:385`, `392-396`) that chains them, which neither original report examined. |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Expected** | Per README FR-09's formula (for this input, `final_amount = 900,000`) and README FR-08 line 107 (backend must recompute/persist the correct total, never trust an unchecked client-supplied value): the order persisted by a successful mobile checkout, after applying `SAVE10` to a 1,000,000₫ cart, must have a stored `total_amount` of `900,000`. `expected_source`: `spec`. |
| **Actual** | `App.js:385` sets `finalAmount = couponResult.final_amount`, which — per issue #4's confirmed mechanism — would be `10,000,000` for this input (see `ER-09-EP-004`); `App.js:392-396` sends this value as `total_amount` in the `POST /api/checkout` body; `backend/server.js:297-309` (issue #1's confirmed mechanism) inserts this value into the `orders` table with zero recomputation. Persisted `total_amount`: `10,000,000`, not `900,000`. |
| **Repro steps** | 1. (Would-be) log in on the mobile app. 2. Add items to the cart totaling 1,000,000₫. 3. Open checkout, type `SAVE10`, tap "Áp dụng" — per `ER-09-EP-004`, the coupon box would show a negative "Tiết kiệm" and an inflated "Thành tiền." 4. Tap "Xác Nhận Thanh Toán" — per this chain, the order persisted would carry `total_amount: 10,000,000`. |
| **Root cause** | Two already-documented root causes (`server.js:398-401` for #4, `server.js:297-309` for #1), joined by `App.js:385`/`392-396`'s unconditional pass-through of `couponResult.final_amount` into the checkout call, with no client-side sanity check of any kind between the two. |
| **Evidence** | Cites `frontend-mobile/App.js:385, 392-396` + GitHub issues #1 and #4. |
| **Status** | `approved` and filed — [issue #25](https://github.com/BuhDuy256/eshop-sut-hw2-testing/issues/25). |

## Human gate: `approve → file`

- [x] Approve `BUG-09-001` for promotion + GitHub issue, cross-referencing #1 and #4. → filed as
  [#25](https://github.com/BuhDuy256/eshop-sut-hw2-testing/issues/25).
- [x] Approve posting reconfirmation evidence for issues #3, #4, #5. → #3 still existed, comment
  posted; #4 and #5 were found deleted (`410`) and re-filed fresh as
  [#26](https://github.com/BuhDuy256/eshop-sut-hw2-testing/issues/26) and
  [#27](https://github.com/BuhDuy256/eshop-sut-hw2-testing/issues/27).

  **Approved 2026-07-07** under the student's standing blanket approval ("Continue the remaining
  tasks ok? Finish all the jobs. I approved all your suggestion. All human in the loop is
  passed."), which the student stated explicitly covers all remaining Human Gates for this
  feature. The #4/#5-deleted discovery was not itself pre-approved by name, but falls within the
  same blanket approval's scope (routine filing mechanics, no new technical claim) — see the AI
  Audit correction entry for this artifact.

## Summary

- **Executed (inferred):** 13 cases.
- **PASS:** 9. **FAIL:** 4.
- **Confirmed defects this pass:** 4 (3 reconfirmations of #3/#4/#5 via a new mobile evidence
  path; 1 new — `BUG-09-001`).
- **By severity (new defect only):** 1 Critical (`BUG-09-001`).
- **Evidence basis:** 4/4 confirmed defects are spec-grounded (0 assumption-grounded —
  every expected result cited README FR-08/FR-09 directly, no case rested on an unaccepted
  assumption). 0 reclassifications between spec-grounded and assumption-grounded during review.
